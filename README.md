## Ecommerce App - React Native Frontend with Redux Toolkit

This project is a React Native frontend for an ecommerce app, built using Redux Toolkit for state management. It utilizes various libraries including RTK, Axios, Stripe, React Navigation, React Native Toast, and many more.

### Features

- **Redux Toolkit (RTK):** The project leverages the Redux Toolkit library for efficient state management. RTK simplifies common Redux tasks, such as creating actions and reducers, making it easier to build and maintain the app's state.

- **Axios:** Axios is used for making HTTP requests to the server and handling responses. It provides a convenient and reliable way to communicate with the backend API.

- **Stripe:** The Stripe library is integrated into the app for secure and seamless payment processing. It enables users to make purchases using their preferred payment methods and ensures the security of their sensitive information.

- **React Navigation:** React Navigation is used for implementing navigation within the app. It allows for smooth transitions between screens, deep linking, and other navigation-related functionalities.

- **React Native Toast:** The React Native Toast library is utilized to display informative and user-friendly toast notifications. It provides a non-intrusive way to communicate important messages to the user.
